# Hermes Agent

[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) is Nous Research's
self-hosted agent. It reads MCP servers from `mcp_servers` in its `config.yaml`,
typically at `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/config.yaml`.

There are two halves, and you want both. The **plugin** enforces the policy:
it refuses a write that adds an explanatory comment and refuses to let a turn
finish while the repository gates are failing. The **MCP server** lets Hermes
read the reasoning that is already recorded. Neither substitutes for the other.

## Install the plugin

```sh
hermes plugins install koment-dev/koment-hermes
```

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - koment
```

It hooks `pre_tool_call` and `pre_verify`, shelling out to the `koment` binary
so that the decision is the same one CI and every other editor integration
makes. Set `KOMENT_PLUGIN_DISABLED=1` to silence it without uninstalling; it
also stays quiet when `koment` is not on the `PATH`. See
[the plugin README](https://github.com/koment-dev/koment/tree/main/plugins/koment/.hermes-plugin).

## Configure — local

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  koment:
    command: "koment"
    args: ["mcp", "--write"]
```

Hermes launches the server as a subprocess, so the binary must be on the `PATH`
of the Hermes process, and Hermes must be running with your repository as its
working directory.

## Configure — remote

If Hermes runs somewhere other than the machine holding the code — a container,
a cluster — the subprocess approach cannot work: the server has to run next to
the repository. Serve koment over HTTP instead, from inside the checkout:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/repo
koment mcp --http 8765
```

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  koment:
    url: "http://koment.internal:8765"
```

**koment's current HTTP transport has no authentication.** Anything that can reach
the port can read every annotation in the repository. It binds loopback unless
you say otherwise, and warns at startup when you do. If Hermes is on another
host, put the port behind something that authenticates or restrict it at the
network level. The approved served tier replaces this behaviour
([ADR 0105](../decisions/0105-authenticated-writes-materialize-through-git.md)).

## Filter the tools

The remote transport exposes only the three read tools. If you are trimming a
local writable tool surface:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  koment:
    command: "koment"
    args: ["mcp", "--write"]
    tools:
      include: ["koment_get", "koment_search", "koment_repositories"]
```

## Make it read them

Hermes reads `AGENTS.md`. Add:

```markdown
Before editing any file, call `koment_get` on it and read the annotations.
Treat an `ambiguous`, `drifted` or `orphaned` annotation as history, not as
current fact. Search koment before changing a non-obvious decision. Do not add
an explanatory inline comment; record local rationale with koment and
project-wide rationale in an ADR.
```

## Notes

- Hermes keeps its own long-term memory. That is a *different thing* from koment
  and the two do not overlap: a memory store consolidates, paraphrases and
  eventually forgets, which is the right behaviour for preferences and wrong for
  a verbatim record anchored to a line of code. koment deliberately does not use
  one as a backend. Git remains the exact record
  ([ADR 0100](../decisions/0100-one-git-record-per-annotation.md)).
