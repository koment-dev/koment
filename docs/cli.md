Exit codes: `0` fine, `1` drift or failure, `2` misuse.

koment finds your repository by walking up from the working directory looking
for `.koment/`, then `.git/`.

---

## add

Records a new annotation.

```sh
koment add internal/auth/token.go \
    --excerpt 'if token.Expiry.Before(now.Add(-clockSkew)) {' \
    --kind gotcha --body 'Bit us in #412.'
```

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--excerpt <text>` | verbatim snippet to anchor to. Omit for a file-scoped annotation. |
| `--kind <kind>` | `why`, `gotcha`, `invariant` or `anti-pattern`. Required. |
| `--title <text>` | optional headline, one line, at most 72 characters. When omitted, the first sentence of the body is shown (ADR 0115). |
| `--body <text>` | the rationale. `-` reads stdin, which is easier for prose. |

The excerpt must appear **exactly once**. Absent or ambiguous is refused, so a
bad anchor is caught while you are still there to fix it. Prints the new id.

The file may come before or after the flags.

## show

Annotations for one file, resolved against what is on disk now.

```sh
koment show internal/auth/token.go
```

Exits `1` if any annotation for that file is ambiguous, drifted or orphaned. A
file with no annotations says so and exits `0`.

## check

The drift gate. Resolves everything and fails on `ambiguous`, `drifted` or
`orphaned`.

```sh
koment check
koment check internal/ cmd/
```

Prints only failures, plus a summary line. With paths, only annotations for
files under those paths are checked — convenient in a monorepo, and a way to
miss drift elsewhere.

## list

Everything, for review.

```sh
koment list
koment list --kind invariant
koment list internal/store
```

Exits `1` if anything shown is ambiguous, drifted or orphaned.

## search

Searches annotation ids, files, kinds, bodies and author identity through the
same repository snapshot as every other reader.

```sh
koment search 'clock skew'
```

Matches include their current resolution status and full body. The command
exits `1` when a matching record is ambiguous, drifted or orphaned so scripted
readers cannot mistake stale rationale for current fact.

## reanchor

Repoints an annotation without touching YAML. Keeps its id and creation date —
it is the same annotation, only where it points changed.

```sh
koment reanchor 01KYW1ETE3CVB6S0ND70GGZVWM --excerpt 'if token.Expired(now) {'
koment reanchor 01KYW1ETE3CVB6S0ND70GGZVWM --file internal/auth/session.go
```

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--excerpt <text>` | new snippet, in the target file |
| `--file <path>` | move to another file; keeps the existing excerpt unless `--excerpt` is also given |

At least one is required. The surrounding context and last seen line are
recaptured from source, never typed. The new excerpt is validated exactly as
`add` validates one. Ids come from `check` output, ready to paste.

## edit

Rewrites the prose of an existing annotation, keeping everything else.

```sh
koment edit 01KZN63VC5SZASDYJBMPDC03WB --title 'A better headline, written later'
echo 'Rewritten rationale.' | koment edit 01KZN63VC5SZASDYJBMPDC03WB --body -
```

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--title <text>` | replace the headline shown beside the code |
| `--body <text>` | replace the rationale. `-` reads stdin |

At least one is required. Identity, author, creation date and the anchor are
not editable here — the anchor belongs to `reanchor`, and the rest is
provenance. Titles are still capped at 72 characters; `edit` exists so that
limit stops being permanent (ADR 0133).

## forget

Deletes an annotation.

```sh
koment forget 01KZN63VC5SZASDYJBMPDC03WB
```

There is no tombstone and no `--reason`. Git already records who removed it,
when, and the full prior content, so duplicating that inside the data would
leave every retired annotation in `list`, `search` and the published site
forever. The command prints the headline it removed and the exact
`git checkout --` that brings it back (ADR 0133).

## bootstrap

Sets koment up in a repository: creates `.koment/`, writes the policy, and
installs the agent adapters you choose.

```sh
koment bootstrap                       # asks which agents you use
koment bootstrap --all --non-interactive
koment bootstrap --policy-only
```

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--agents <list>` | comma-separated adapters to install |
| `--all` | every adapter koment knows |
| `--policy-only` | write `.koment/policy.yaml` and nothing else |
| `--non-interactive` | never prompt; requires one of the three above |

## version

Prints the release, the source revision, the Go toolchain and the platform.

```sh
koment version
```

## site

Renders a repository snapshot to static HTML — the published tier
([ADR 0103](decisions/0103-three-tiers-with-human-and-agent-capabilities.md)).
See [publishing](publishing.md) for the workflow to copy.

```sh
koment site --out dist
koment site --out dist --name myrepo --commit-link "$url/commit/$sha"
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `--out <dir>` | where to write. Required. |
| `--name <text>` | repository name on every page; defaults to the repository's own |
| `--commit <sha>` | the commit rendered; read from git when omitted |
| `--commit-link <url>` | make the commit clickable |
| `--banner <text>` · `--banner-link <url>` | a notice on every page |
| `--repository <id>` | which repository, when several are configured |
| `--repository-links <name=URL,...>` | contextual switcher entries for a grouped publication |

Every page names its commit, and `koment site` **refuses to render** when it
cannot determine one: a snapshot that does not say what it is a snapshot of is
how a stale rendering passes for the current tree. Pass `--commit` outside git.

It is a snapshot, not your working tree — use `koment ui` for that, which
re-resolves on every request. The shared target behaviour is defined by
[ADR 0102](decisions/0102-one-repository-snapshot-for-every-reader.md). A site
renders your source as well as your annotations.
The output directory is replaced atomically and also contains full
`annotations.json` and flattened `search.json` projections.

## comments

`koment comments check` is the authoritative gate preventing ordinary Go
comments from bypassing the repository procedure. Toolchain directives,
generated markers, upstream links, deprecation markers and public API
documentation are classified through `.koment/policy.yaml`.

```sh
koment comments check
koment comments convert internal/auth/token.go --excerpt '// Explain why.' --kind gotcha
koment comments acknowledge internal/auth/token.go \
  --excerpt '// Required external marker.' \
  --body 'The generator consumes this exact marker.' \
  --acknowledge-inline-comment
```

Conversion writes an attributed annotation before removing the comment.
Acknowledgement keeps the comment and creates an exact, attributed policy
record; omitting the explicit flag is always rejected.

## agents

`koment agents install` creates the strict default `.koment/policy.yaml` and
generates the selected repository instructions, MCP configs and supported
client hooks while preserving unrelated configuration. Run it again after a
policy or adapter change. `koment agents check` fails when any managed surface
is missing or stale.

## ui

Local web view — your code with its annotations in the margin.

```sh
koment ui
koment ui --listen 8080
koment ui --write
```

Binds loopback and prints the URL. `--write` prints a capability-bearing
bootstrap URL and is refused on non-loopback addresses. Opening that URL sets a
same-site, HTTP-only capability cookie; the visible form writes human-authored
annotations through the same application service as CLI and MCP.

## mcp

The MCP server. See [agent setup](agents/).

```sh
koment mcp                            # stdio, the default
koment mcp --write                    # stdio plus mutation tools
koment mcp --http 8765                # HTTP, JSON responses
koment mcp --streamable-http 8765     # HTTP, server-sent events
```

Exposes `koment_get(file, repository?)`, `koment_search(query, repository?)` and
`koment_repositories()`. stdio is what you want unless the agent cannot spawn a
subprocess.

`--write` adds `koment_add`, `koment_reanchor`, `koment_convert_comment` and
`koment_acknowledge_comment`. It is valid only over local stdio; HTTP transports
are always read-only.

With several repositories configured, an ambiguous `koment_get` fails and names
the candidates instead of picking one.

The `/mcp` route on `koment serve` is a separate authenticated surface over the
same protocol. Scoped writers receive `koment_add`; a successful call includes
the reviewed Git branch, commit and pull-request URL.

## serve

The database-free multi-repository service. It synchronizes each configured
GitHub branch to one immutable commit, builds the complete snapshot away from
requests and atomically replaces the active repository only after validation.

```sh
koment serve --config repositories.yaml
koment serve --config repositories.yaml \
  --credentials-file credentials.yaml \
  --github-token-file github-token \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080
```

`/`, `/mcp`, `/livez` and `/readyz` share the application listener. Source,
rationale, UI and MCP require authentication on a non-loopback address;
liveness and readiness remain public. `--metrics` starts an independent
listener. Forwarded human identity is accepted only from `--trusted-proxies`.
Bearer files contain SHA-256 token hashes, repository scopes and `read` or
`write` permissions; provider tokens are read from files and never from chart
values.

Remote writes create review pull requests and never edit a replica or push the
default branch. A failed refresh keeps the previous complete snapshot and makes
readiness fail until synchronization recovers.

## lsp

`koment lsp` runs the editor-neutral Language Server Protocol process over
stdio. It supports full-document synchronization, diagnostics, hover, code
lenses, quick fixes and execute commands for add, reanchor, comment conversion
and explicit inline acknowledgement. Each document discovers its own repository,
so multi-root workspaces cannot cross their mutation boundary.

The reference VS Code extension starts this command automatically. Other editor
clients can consume the standard LSP methods directly; rich virtual inline text
is an editor presentation feature and never changes the source buffer.

## Record format

`.koment/annotations/<id>.yaml`:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koment-dev/koment/main/schema/v1alpha/annotation.schema.json
apiVersion: koment.dev/v1alpha
kind: Annotation
metadata:
  id: 01KYW1ETE3CVB6S0ND70GGZVWM
  created: "2026-07-31T10:04:00Z"
spec:
  target:
    file: internal/store/ulid.go
  type: gotcha
  body: |-
    26 Crockford characters carry 130 bits but a ULID holds 128, so the
    value is left-padded by two.
  anchor:
    scope: excerpt
    excerpt: "\tpaddingBits = ulidLength*bitsPerChar - 8*(...)"
    before: const (
    after: )
  author:
    name: Jan Pucilowski
    kind: human
    source: git-config
status:
  lastSeenLine: 18
```

Hand-editing works, with schema completion in editors that support YAML schemas.
Unknown fields and a filename that differs from `id` are rejected. `reanchor`
exists so context is normally captured from source rather than typed.

`status.lastSeenLine` is descriptive, never an anchor: exact text and the captured
`before` and `after` context choose identity. The line only distinguishes `ok`
after one candidate remains.
